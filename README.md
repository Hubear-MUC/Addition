Version 2.2:

Placed the line with the actual operation one line below so that an opening
curly bracket can be used as breakpoint.
This might appear more clearly as the breakpoint positioned before the
operation.


Version 2.1:

Placed the function block of main() in the next line to make the code readable
more clearly.


Version 2.0:

Implemented a second variable (b) to allow the addition of two numbers.


Version 1.0:

Initial commit.
