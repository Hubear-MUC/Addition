Changes:

Version 4.0:

Replacing the data type "int" by "float" so that floating point numbers now
can be used for the calculation.


Version 3.1:

Placing the closing curly bracket in a new line to make the code readable
more clearly


Version 3.0:

Introducing the variable c as a third variable, so that the result is in a
seperate one as the two summands.

This might be a little more clear as an idea of getting a result.


Version 2.3:

Placed the closing curly bracket in a new line to make the code readable
more clearly.
In this style it looks like a usual C- program.


Version 2.2:

Placed the line with the actual operation one line below so that an opening
curly bracket can be used as breakpoint.
This might appear more clearly as the breakpoint positioned before the
operation.


Version 2.1:

Placed the function block of main() in the next line to make the code readable
more clearly.


Version 2.0:

Implemented a second variable (b) to allow the addition of two numbers.


Version 1.0:

Initial commit.
